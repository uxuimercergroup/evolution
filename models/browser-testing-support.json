IE Compatibility mode is also not web standards compliant. Evolution supports IE9 and up, in standards mode. Lastly, through a meta tag, we tell IE to render at the highest version and standards mode available in the version of IE currently being used."

Since we want the buttons to look like buttons we have chosen the gradient of the button over the rounded corners. IE9 will have square corners everywhere."
