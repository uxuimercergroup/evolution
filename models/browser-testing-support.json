		"question": "Why are corners no longer rounded in IE9?",
		"answer": "IE9 has trouble applying rounded corners and gradients (which are applied using an IE filter since IE9 does not understand CSS3 gradient background). Since we want the buttons for example to look like buttons we have chosen the gradient of the button over the rounded corners. So for rounded corners IE8 and IE9 should have the same display, square corners everywhere."

		{
		"question": "Is Evolution Library Responsive?",
		"answer": "IE8 does not have support for media queries which are used for responsive web design but we provide a script to accomplish this in IE called respond.js.You should not worry about responsiveness with IE8 however as there are not many mobile devices that use IE8 as their browser. IE9 understands media queries and should work."
