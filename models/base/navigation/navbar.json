	"reference-overview": 
		"<p>The Navigation Bar is denoted by the gray background area. If it is used, it will always be displayed immediately underneath the <a href='/base/header/masthead'>Masthead</a>. There are two primary versions:</p><ul><li>Tabs</li><li>Mega Menu</li></ul><p>In addition, there are other optional pieces that can be used, including Text Links, Secondary Icons, User Identifier.</p>",

	"reference-usage": 
		"<p>The Navigation Bar should be used in conjunction with the <a href='/masthead'>Masthead</a> to create the overall <a href='/base/product-header'>Product Header</a>. The <strong>Tabs</strong> version should be used when you want to explicitly convey the main site structure in the main navigation. The <strong> Mega Menu</strong> version should be used when you want the main navigation accessible on each screen but not necessarily front and center on the sceen.</p>",

	"reference-details": 
		"<p>The primary difference between the Mega Menu and the Tabs version is in how you want to present the structural navigation options to the user. </p><h4>Mega Menu Version</h4><p>The Mega Menu hides the structural navigation from the baseline UI, but makes it accessible by clicking or tapping on the menu icon. When clicked, a menu slides down that exposes the navigation options. Within this slide down menu area, there are two main sections: <ul><li>Showcase Area</li><ul><li>This area sits on top fo the Navigation Section and should be used to showcase any specific links or destinations that are higher in prominence</a>.</li></ul><li>Navigation Section</li><ul><li>Can be organized into any grid comnbination using the <a href='/base/grids'>Evolution Grid System</a>.</li><li>Can support multiple levels of categorization using section headers.</li></ul></ul></p><h4>Tabs Version</h4><p>This version of the Navigation bar provides the user with the main structural navigation in the form of consistent navigation options. These options are separated from one another by creating a visual indicator of tabs. These menu items can support multiple levels of submenus if desired.</p><h4>Other Configurations</h4><p>The following additional configurable elements can be used with either version of the Navigation Bar.</p><ul><li>Secondary Icons - These additional icons follow the same basic interaction pattern as the Mega Menu; when a user clicks or taps an icon, an associated menu will slide down. Some of the common uses for Secondary Icons are Shopping Cart, Documents, Messages, Sign Out and more.</li><li>Ancillary Text Links - This optional area can be used to expose secondary navigation items in a consistent manner. These menu items are intended to be secondary in nature, which is why they are presented as text. They can support multiple levels of menuing themselves.</li><li>Custom Message - If necessary, the Navigation Bar can easily support a custom text message.</li></ul>",

	"reference-mobile": 
		"<p>The behavior of the Navigation Bar when viewed on mobile differs according to which version is being used.</p><h4>Mega Menu</h3><ul><li>The Mega Menu icon behavior remains unchanged.</li><li>All Ancillary Text Links are removed from the default view and instead become accessible inside the Mega Menu.</li><li>All Secondary Icons are removed from the default view and instead become accessible inside the Mega Menu.</li><li>Any Custom Text Message that is used in the Navigation Bar is removed from the default mobile view.</li></ul><h4>Tabs </h4><ul><li>When viewed on mobile, the Tabs view will always be replaced by the Mega Menu version. </li><li>All of the top level Tab items are removed from the default view and are instead moved into the Mega Menu</li><li>If multiple levels of navigation are used in the Tabs, all levels will be accessible in the mobile view by tapping the top level item.</li></ul>",
