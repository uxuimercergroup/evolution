		"<p>Start by adding an element with a class of row. This will create a horizontal block to contain vertical columns. Then add divs with a columns class within that row. Specify the widths of each column with the <code>small-#</code>, <code>medium-#</code>, and <code>large-#</code> classes. Code for small screens first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.</p><p>The collapse class lets you remove column gutters (padding). There are times that your needs to collapse may not be the same across devices so you can use the <code>small-collapse</code>, <code>medium-collapse</code> and <code>large-collapse</code>.</p>",
