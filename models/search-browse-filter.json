  "reference-overview": 
    "<p>When <strong>browsing</strong>, users scan or skim information displayed on a page. Users may or may not be looking for something in particular when <strong>browsing</strong>. <strong>Searching</strong> is a bit more proactive than <strong>browsing</strong> because users have key terms, images, people, elements, dates, etc., in mind and proactively plug specific “search terms” into the search box, which then showcases results that match those terms. Filtering allows users to further syphon data while <strong>browsing</strong> or searching by removing and showcasing items based on selected criteria.</p><p><strong>Searching</strong> and <strong>filtering</strong> are primarily used together when users need to locate specific items within large, unknown groupings of results. They may have limited or incomplete details regarding the specific data they need to access. They then enter 1 or more details associated with the data set to enable the system to perform the preliminary \"filter\" and return filtered results.</p><p>Browsing and <strong>filtering</strong> can also go hand-in-hand. When used together, <strong>browsing</strong> and <strong>filtering</strong> allow users to directly access and view entire data sets, while still having the option to sort and filter the results in more detail.</p><h3>Search Components:</h3><ul><li>Single search entry field or multiple choice metadata options</li><li>\"Search\" button</li><li>Can be combined with <a href='/objects/auto-suggest'>auto-suggest</a> functionality</li></ul><h3>Browse Components:</h3><ul><li>Access to full data set</li><li>Data table containing full set of results with default sorting capabilities</li></ul><h3>Filtering Components:</h3><ul><li>Single filter entry field accompanies all results sets</li><li>Can be combined with <a href='/objects/auto-suggest'>auto-suggest</a> functionality</li><li>Multiple choice \"Advance\" filter options may also be provided</li><li>\"Filter\" button</li></ul>"
