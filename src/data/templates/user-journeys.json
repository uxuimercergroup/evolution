		"text": "<p>A user journey is a term to describe a series of steps that a user encounters when they interact with your product or content. Usually, they are represented as a visual map to help better identify key actions and features, understand emotional and logical hurdles, and therefore drives the scope of work, discover true objectives, and formulate strategies to improve the your product or content as the need arises.</p><p>Think of a user journey as telling a story, with a beginnig, middle, and end. Depending on what story you are trying to tell, the stories can range from simple to complex, can be linear or contain multiple and/or repeating patterns. Whatever it may be, a user journey is used to gain insight from the particular user’s perspective, and not based on the business’ idealization of their own interests.</p>"
