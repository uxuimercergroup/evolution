			"title": "Atoms",
			"description": "<p>In chemistry, atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. They have distinct properties and can't be broken down further without losing their meaning.</p><p>Translated to interfaces, atoms are basic tags, such as form labels, inputs or buttons. They also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts, and animations.</p>"

		{
			"title": "Molecules",
			"description": "<p>In chemistry, molecules are groups of atoms bonded together, which take on new properties as a result.</p><p>In interfaces, molecules are groups of elements that function together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button atom can combine them together to form a search form molecule.</p><p>Building up from atoms to molecules encourages a “do one thing and do it well” mentality, and encourages creating reusable interface patterns.</p>"

		{
			"title": "Namespace",
			"description": "<p>A name given to an element for the explicit purpose of containing the application of properties.</p><p>In Evolution, components are given the class name evo to help distinguish them from parts of elements in code, and to provide a namespace for definitions which can limit the scope of CSS rules.</p>"

		{
			"title": "Organisms",
			"description": "<p>Organisms are groups of molecules (and possibly atoms) joined together to form distinct section of an interface.</p><p>Organisms can consist of similar and/or disparate molecule types. For example, a masthead organism might consist of a logo, navigation, and search form, while a “product grid” organism might consist of the same product info molecule repeated over and over.</p><p>Building up from molecules to organisms encourages creating standalone, portable, reusable components.</p>"

Within a given version number category (major, minor, patch), these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments."
