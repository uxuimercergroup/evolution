##### General
- By default, a dropdown anchors below the button that opened it. Add the class .top, .right, or .bottom to the dropdown to change this.
- The autoclose option is enabled by default and allows the dropdown to close automatically when a link is clicked within the dropdown.
- Dropdows are accessible on click, but can be made to be accessible by hover. The default setting for `data-hover-delay` is 250ms.
