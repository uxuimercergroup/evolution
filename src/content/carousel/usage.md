##### Setup
To initialize the carousel you need match the `data-evo-carousel` attribute value with the init value used in the carousel JavaScript initialization. The initialization example used below is`evo-carousel-example`. This will need to be unique for each carousel that you create.

If you need to customize the carousel beyond the default options, you should do so by adding additional attributes to the "Carousel example with options" section, which can be found on this page [Customizing Carousel](http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/#customizing).
