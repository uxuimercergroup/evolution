##### General

An Equalizer group consists of a parent container that contains a series of child elements. The child elements will all be resized to have the same height.

##### Responsive Equalizer

You can specify media queries for which equalizer should activate on. 


##### Nested Elements

You can also nest "equalized" child elements in other Equalizer child elements. 

##### Equalize By Row

If you have a gallery of items that wrap multiple times, Equalizer can be configured to match each row's items in height. Works great with the block grid!
