##### Basics

A top bar (`.top-bar`) can have two sections: a left-hand section (`.top-bar-left`) and a right-hand section (`.top-bar-right`). 

The top bar includes dropdown menus. The dropdown menu inherits the background color of the top bar.

##### Advanced Layout

You can further divide a top bar into a title area and content area. Use the `.top-bar-title` class to create a title/branding area. Next to that can be any element, which is used for the rest of the content.
