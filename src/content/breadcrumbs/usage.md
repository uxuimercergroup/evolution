To make a set of breadcrumb links, just add classes of `.breadcrumbs .evo-breadcrumbs` to a `<ul>`, and then add links inside of `<li>` elements.

The current page doesn't require a link or a class, but you should add some explanatory text for screen readers that indicates which item is the current page.

To mark a disabled item, add the class `.disabled` to the `<li>`, and just use plain text instead of a link.
