##### General

* Use the Basic Table when you want to organize data that the user doesn't need to interact with
* Text will wrap in basic rows to adapt to longer content, but the label rows will stay in the same position, which is vertically aligned to the top of the row
* Don't use the tables in a sidebar, unless you only need to display a small amount of data

##### Mobile

When tables are viewed on small screens, the table will be displayed as seen on the desktop. When the user touches the screen (or swipes to the left) a scroll bar will appear which allows them to view the entire table. They are then able to swipe right and left to view the contents.
