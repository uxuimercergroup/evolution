##### Disable For Touch Events
If you don't want tooltips to interfere with a touch event, you can disable them for those devices by adding `data-options="disable_for_touch:true"`. Tooltips applied to a tags will automatically be disabled for touch events, so as not to interfere with the link.

##### Shapes
Adding the classes `.radius` or `.round` to a tooltip will apply the border radius only to the outside corners.

##### Show By Screen Size
You can now also add `show_on` to your `data-options` attribute to allow your tooltips to show on only `small`, `medium`, or `large` screens. Tooltips will show on all screen sizes by default.
