##### General

By default, a tooltip appears below the defined term on hover.

##### Position

To get a tip-top top tooltip, just add the class `.top` to the `<span>` element.

You can also position the tooltips to the right and left of the word by adding the classes `.right` or `.left` to the `<span>` element.

##### Show By Screen Size

You can use the data attribute of `data-show-on` to allow your tooltips to show on only `small`, `medium`, or `large` screens. Tooltips will show on all screen sizes by default (`small`).
