##### General
The Auto Complete automatically inputs suggested items for users while filling out any type of form. This control works well when input speed is important for the user or when data might be entered in different ways.

###### User Benefits

- Auto Complete text is generated from a pre-defined set of data
- The Auto Complete feature should be used when issues of ambiguity might arise (in place of a Text Input) while filling out a form.
- It’s great when extremely long lists of predefined data preclude the use of a drop down selection.
- It’s also quite useful when the user only has a certain amount of time to fill out a form.
- The Auto Complete control should be able to support "Starts With" or "Contains" searches
- The preference is to default to "Contains" in order to maximize the return.
