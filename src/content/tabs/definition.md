##### General
The Tab Set control is a supplementary navigational system that controls the display of large groups of related content. It essentially organizes content into logical/easy to digest chunks that are displayed one at a time. Tab Sets help organize content on the page and keep sites looking neat and clean, so users won't be overwhelmed by tons of content.

This Tab Set control should be used when you want to manage the display of distinct, yet related groups of content that are connected to a single concept.

It's a great feature when there is a lot of content that needs to be displayed as it only presents a subset of the content and keeps the rest hidden until another tab is selected.
