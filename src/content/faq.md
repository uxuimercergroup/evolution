Below are some of the most frequently asked questions that we get about Evolution.
***

##### Is Evolution responsive?
Evolution is built to be mobile first. This means that Evolution is developed for mobile then through media queries minor adjustments are made to allow patterns to work on the desktop.

##### What browsers and devices does Evolution support?
Evolution has been designed and tested for many browsers and devices. If you would like to see the latest information of what is supported please visit our [compatibility](/compatibility.html) page.

##### Does Evolution support IE Compatibility Mode?
Evolution does not support IE Compatibility mode for any version of IE. IE Compatibility mode will make IE render as IE7 (or worse) which is not supported by Evolution. IE Compatibility mode is also not web standards compliant. Evolution supports IE9 and up, in standards mode. Lastly, through a meta tag, we tell IE to render at the highest version and standards mode available in the version of IE currently being used by the user.

##### Why don't animations work in IE9?
Animations require that browsers support CSS3 Animations. IE9 does not support CSS3 animations and degrades gracefully.
