SETUP A PROJECT WITH A MIXTURE BOILERPLATE USING MUL UX/UI LIBRARY
======================================================================================================

The following instructions will help you setup Mixture to use our custom MUL Boilerplate which allows a UI developer to start a project using the UX/UI Library. This boilerplate has been developed to accelerate the development of sites for our group and to provide a consistent starting point for rapid prototyping and development.

Setup Instructions

1.  Download Mixture (http://mixture.io/)
2.  If on Windows 7, once Mixture is installed set it up to always be run as administrator.  You can do so by following these steps:

	a.  Run as administrator in Window 7 - http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff431742.aspx
	b.  On the Start menu, locate the program that you want to always run as an administrator. 
	c.  Right-click the application's shortcut and then click Properties. 
	d.  In the Properties dialog box, click the Compatibility tab. 
	e.  Do one of the following: 

			1.  To apply the setting to the currently logged-on user, select the Run This Program As An Administrator check box, and then click OK. 
			2.  To apply the setting to all users on the computer and regardless of which shortcut is used to start the application, click Change Setting For All Users to display the Properties dialog box for the application's .exe file, select the Run This Program As An Administrator check box, and then click OK twice.

3.  Sign up for Mixture after installing software.
4.  Mixture requires a license key. We have bulk licenses but you may need a license key purchased for you. Please contact Jeff Tudor (jeff.tudor@mercer.com) to request a license/purchase a license.
5.  Redeem your license by logging in to Mixture's site at https://accounts.mixture.io/login
6.  At the Mixture account site (https://accounts.mixture.io/login), click on the "Boilerplates" link in the top navigation.
7.  Under "Add a boilerplate" entering the following info into the fields

	a.  Name: MUL Boilerplate
	b.  GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/mgholmes/mul_mixture_boilerplate (NOTE: this will be updated later with a UI Development shared GitHub account, not my own - Matt)
	c.  Description: A custom Mixture boilerplate using the MUL UX/UI Library.

8.  Click "Confirm & Add". You should have a boilerplate listed at the bottom of the page. Keep the boilerplate private.
9.  Open Mixture and sign in with your account info.
10. In your preferred operating system, create a directory for a new project that will use the MUL boilerplate.
11. In Mixture, click on "Private".
12. Click on the "MUL Boilerplate" and a dialog window will come up asking for a directory where you will download the boilerplate.
13. Choose the directory you created in step 9. Mixture will download the MUL boilerplate into that directory.
14. Once Mixture is done downloading the MUL boilerplate it will create a project in Mixture with the name of the directory where you downloaded the boilerplate.
15. In Mixture, click on "Settings", this will open the Mixture settings in your text editor of choice.
16. In the settings files for this Mixture project you can change the following:

	a.  "projectName" – name your project something else if you want
	b.  "projectDescription" – give your project a description that displays in Mixture

17. In the settings file look for this entry:

	a.  "serverHostname": "project.mercerhrs.com"
	b.  Change this address to the name of the project you are working on, for example if the project name is "Sample Site" change the serverHostname to: samplesite.mercerhrs.com

18. Save the Mixture settings file and close.
19. Edit your computers host file to point your localhost (127.0.0.1) to your serverHostname setting in Mixture, for example:

	a.  127.0.0.1 	samplesite.mercerhrs.com

20. When editing your computers host file always do so as an admin or it won't save. On Windows you can download and install a utility called Hostsman (http://www.abelhadigital.com/hostsman) to accomplish this easily, just remember to run as administrator in the program. On a Mac, you can use the Terminal to edit the computers host file, for more info check out this link: http://osxdaily.com/2012/08/07/edit-hosts-file-mac-os-x/

	c.  Select "Run as Administrator" from the above menu
	d.  There will be a notification window that comes up, select "Yes"
	e.  Look to the bottom of the program and click on "Editor"
	f.  In the new window you want to click the green "+" sign in the top left
	g.  Type the Mixture serverHostname  (for example, samplesite.mercerhrs.com) in box that your cursor is in
	h.  Click the "Add" button to the right
	i.  Once you have done that you just need to save it by clicking the "Save" icon in the top left of the program

22. Save your host file if you haven't already done so.
23. In Mixture, click on "View locally".
24. If everything is setup correctly you should see the MUL boilerplate in your browser at the serverHostname you specified in the Mixture settings (samplesite.mercerhrs.com in these instructions).
25. You can now start developing your project in your editor of choice using the MUL boilerplate as a starting point.

OTHER NOTES
======================================================================================================
	
Windows Version
-------------------------------------------------------------------

So Mixture does not keep bothering you to run admin every time you update settings, change Mixture to always 
run as administrator in Window 7:
REFERENCE ARTICLE - http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff431742.aspx

1. On the Start menu, locate the program that you want to always run as an administrator. 
2. Right-click the application's shortcut, and then click Properties. 
3. In the Properties dialog box, click the Compatibility tab. 
4. Do one of the following: 
To apply the setting to the currently logged-on user, select the Run This Program As An
Administrator check box, and then click OK.

To apply the setting to all users on the computer and regardless of which shortcut is used to start the 
application, click Change Setting For All Users to display the Properties dialog box for the application's .exe 
file, select the Run This Program As An Administrator check box, and then click OK twice.


.liquid file type recognized by Sublime Text 2 as HTML
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open a Mixture .liquid file.
2. Go to View > Syntax > Open all with current extension as...
3. Choose HTML


Custom Host Name
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In mixture.json edit so it looks like this:
- "serverHostname": "{yourprojectname}.mercerhrs.com",

In computer's host file add new line:
- 127.0.0.1 {yourprojectname}.mercerhrs.com

Replace {yourprojectname} with the name of the project you are working on, for example:

samplesite.mercerhrs.com


Files Names
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mixture liquid file names must use a dash in the file name, not underscores. For example:
comp-modal.liquid

Underscores in the .liquid file names break on Windows.
