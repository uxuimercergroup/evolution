Specify the widths of each column with the small-#, medium-#, and large-# classes. Code for small screens first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.</p>",

You still need to put the column you want to display first on mobile first in the code order, so in the example below the code for the right sidebar is first in the code order before the left column.</p>"
