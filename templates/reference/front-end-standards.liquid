					<h4>Getting Started</h4>

					<p>The responsibility of the front-end developer is to understand the goals of the project and the specific deliverables that are expected, taking care to not take them for granted or assume anything.</p>

					<p>It's important to understand how the development environment will work, what tools will be available, and what the differences between development, test, and production environments may ultimately be.</p>

					<p>There needs to be a clear understanding of what the browser and device requirements are from the outset of the project.</p>

					<h5>Pillars of the internet</h5>
					<p>The front-end technology solutions produced adhere to the industry best practices using the following:</p>
